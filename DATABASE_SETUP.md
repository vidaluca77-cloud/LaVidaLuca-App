### Step 4: Verify Setup
```sql
-- Check that tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Verify activities were inserted
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_activities FROM activities;
-- Should return: 30

-- Check categories distribution
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM activities 
GROUP BY category
